## Introduction üåü

Predictix is an app designed to predict the likelihood of customer churn, with the ultimate goal of reducing churn rates and increasing customer satisfaction. By employing Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning, this app analyzes customer feedback to predict sentiment, and then uses this sentiment analysis along with other features to predict whether customers will switch to other services or remain loyal.

### Problem Statement üéØ

In today's competitive market, understanding customer sentiment and predicting churn are crucial for business success. However, manually analyzing large volumes of customer feedback and identifying potential churners is time-consuming and prone to human error. Predictix addresses these challenges by automating both the sentiment analysis process and churn prediction, allowing businesses to respond promptly to customer needs and preferences.

### Objectives üöÄ

1. Understand customer sentiment through their feedback
2. Build a model to classify sentiment in customer reviews
3. Use sentiment analysis results, combined with other features, to predict customer churn
4. Use SVC to predict customer churn.

### Proposed Solution üí°

Predictix utilizes a two-step approach:

1. Sentiment Analysis (`predictix_01_sentiment_analysis.ipynb`):
   - Uses advanced NLP algorithms, including BERT, to preprocess and analyze customer feedback data
   - Employs techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal, and sentiment classification

2. Churn Prediction (`predictix_02_churn_classification.ipynb`):
   - Utilizes the sentiment analysis results as a feature
   - Combines sentiment with other relevant features to predict customer churn using machine learning algorithms

This approach provides accurate and timely insights into customer sentiments and their likelihood of churning.

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

### Dependencies

- Python 3.9+
- PyTorch 2.0+
- Transformers 4.40+
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- etc.

To install Predictix:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/danisarahadians/Predictix-Churn-Sentiment-and-Classification.git
cd predictix
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Getting Started

For the sentiment analysis, you can use the following code:
```python
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForSequenceClassification
import torch

# Specify the directory where the model and tokenizer are saved
model_dir = './saved_model/'

# Load the tokenizer and model
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_dir)
model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_dir)

# Set the model to evaluation mode
model.eval()

# Analyze sentiment
feedback = "The bouquet was absolutely stunning! Fresh flowers and beautiful arrangement."
inputs = tokenizer(
    feedback,
    padding=True,
    truncation=True,
    max_length=128,
    return_tensors='pt'
)

# Perform inference
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(**inputs)
    logits = outputs.logits
    predictions = torch.argmax(logits, dim=-1)

# Predict sentiment
print(f"Sentiment: {sentiment}")
```
For overall classification churn, you can use this following code :
```python
# Import resources
import pandas as pd
import pickle
import numpy as np

with open('model.pkl', 'rb') as file_1:
    classification = pickle.load(file_1)

# Sample data
data = {
    "customer_id": ["CUST023", "CUST024"],
    "tenure": [17, 5],
    "monthly_charges": [2800000, 3400000],
    "total_charges": [47600000, 17000000],
    "contract": ["one year", "month-to-month"],
    "payment_method": ["mailed check", "electronic check"],
    "feedback": ["Reliable and affordable", "Delivery issues multiple times"],
    "topic":["product quality","delivery issues"]
}

# Map predictions to labels
label_map = {0: 'Negative', 1: 'Positive'}
predicted_labels = [label_map[pred.item()] for pred in predictions]

# Print the results
for i, (text, label) in enumerate(zip(data['feedback'], predicted_labels)):
    print(f"Text: {text}\nPredicted Sentiment: {label}\n")

# Concatenate the sentiment labels into a single column
data['sentiment'] = predicted_labels

# Change Datatype to Dataframe
data = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Do prediction
prediction = classification.predict(data)
prediction 
```

## Model Architecture

Predictix uses a fine-tuned BERT model for sentiment analysis. The architecture includes:

- BERT base model
- Custom classification head
- Fine-tuning on florist-specific dataset

After conducting sentiment analysis using BERT, we employ cross-validation to identify the optimal classification model for the florist-specific dataset. The architecture includes the following base models:

- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Naive Bayes
- XGBoost
- Logistic Regression

To further enhance performance, we fine-tune the SVC model specifically for the florist-specific dataset.


## Performance

Our BERT-based model achieves:

- Train Accuracy: 92%
- Validation Accuracy: 94%
- Test Accuracy: 89%

This is the comparison of the performance of the model with other models used in the project:

| Model          | Train Accuracy | Validation Accuracy | Test Accuracy |
|----------------|----------------|---------------------|---------------|
| Random Forest  | 92%            | 91%                 | 87%           |
| LSTM           | 92%            | 92%                 | 89%           |
| BERT           | 92%            | 94%                 | 89%           |

Our fine-tune SVC model achieves:
- Training Recall : 93%
- Test Recall : 89%

This is the comparison of the performance of the model with other models used in the cross-validation for this project:

| Model | Recall - Mean - Cross Validation | Recall - std - Cross Validation | Recall - Range of Test Set |
|---|---|---|---|
| Support Vector Machine | 92.80% | 2.00% | 90.80% - 94.80% |
| Logistic Regression | 92.80% | 2.00% | 90.80% - 94.80% |
| K-Nearest Neighbors | 92.50% | 1.60% | 91.00% - 94.10% |
| Naive Bayes | 92.50% | 2.20% | 90.30% - 94.70% |
| Random Forest | 91.80% | 2.20% | 89.60% - 93.90% |
| XGBoost | 91.80% | 1.70% | 90.10% - 93.40% |
| Decision Tree | 90.50% | 2.70% | 87.90% - 93.20% |
